## Usage

### Basic Multi-Repository Planning

```bash
# Analyze multiple repositories in the same organization
@l multi-plan repo1,repo2,repo3

# Analyze repositories across different organizations
@l multi-plan facebook/react,microsoft/typescript,vercel/next.js

# Mixed format: some with explicit owners, some using current owner
@l multi-plan my-frontend,external-org/shared-lib,my-backend
```

### Alternative Command Formats

```bash
# Using 'multi-repo' command
@l multi-repo frontend,backend,docs

# Using 'aggregate' command  
@l aggregate service-a,service-b,service-c

# Via @uwularpy mention
@uwularpy multi-plan repo1,repo2
```

## Command Parsing

The system supports flexible repository specifications:

### Supported Formats

1. **Repository names only**: `repo1,repo2,repo3`
   - Uses the current repository's owner for all repositories
   
2. **Owner/repository format**: `owner1/repo1,owner2/repo2`
   - Explicit owner specification for each repository
   
3. **Mixed format**: `repo1,owner2/repo2,repo3`
   - Combines both formats as needed

### Repository Validation

- Repository names must be valid GitHub identifiers
- 1-39 characters in length
- Alphanumeric characters, hyphens, underscores, and dots allowed
- Cannot start or end with hyphens
- Cannot contain consecutive dots (`..`)

### Examples

```bash
# ‚úÖ Valid repository specifications
@l multi-plan my-app,my-docs,my-api
@l multi-plan facebook/react,microsoft/typescript
@l multi-plan frontend,backend-org/auth-service,mobile

# ‚ùå Invalid repository names (will be filtered out)
@l multi-plan valid-repo,invalid..repo,toolong-repository-name-exceeding-github-limits
# ‚Üí Only 'valid-repo' will be processed
```

## Workflow

### 1. Command Recognition
- Parse multi-repository command with repository specifications
- Validate repository names and fill in missing owners
- Route to `multi-plan-task` for processing

### 2. Multi-Repository Ingestion
- Process repositories in batches (max 5 concurrent)
- Apply rate limiting and timeout protection
- Handle authentication across different organizations
- Graceful error handling for inaccessible repositories

### 3. Individual Repository Analysis
- Perform comprehensive analysis on each accessible repository
- Use existing single-repository analysis pipeline
- Generate detailed insights for each repository

### 4. Aggregated Analysis
- Combine findings from all repositories
- Generate cross-repository insights using AI
- Identify shared components and integration opportunities
- Create consolidated priority recommendations

### 5. Milestone Creation
- Create comprehensive multi-repository milestone
- Include individual repository breakdowns
- Highlight cross-repository opportunities
- Provide actionable consolidated priorities

## Technical Implementation

### Core Components

#### Multi-Plan Task (`multi-plan-task`)
- **Duration**: 30 minutes (extended for multiple repositories)
- **Machine**: large-2x (increased resources for concurrent processing)
- **Implementation**: `/src/trigger/multi-plan-implementation.ts`

#### Command Parser Extensions
- **File**: `/src/lib/command-parser.ts`
- **New Properties**: `isMultiRepoCommand`, `repositories[]`
- **Validation**: GitHub repository name validation

#### Context Extensions
- **File**: `/src/services/task-types.ts`
- **New Properties**: `isMultiRepo`, `repositories[]`
- **Backward Compatibility**: All existing single-repo functionality preserved

### Configuration

```typescript
// Multi-repository processing limits
const MAX_CONCURRENT_REPOS = 5;     // Concurrent repository processing
const REPO_TIMEOUT_MS = 300000;     // 5 minutes per repository
const MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH = 8000;    // Content limit per repository
const RETRY_ATTEMPTS = 3;           // Retry failed operations
const RETRY_DELAY_MS = 1000;        // Base delay for retries
```

### Rate Limiting

- **Multi-Plan Creation**: Max 2 per minute per repository
- **Repository Processing**: Batched with delays between batches
- **API Calls**: Exponential backoff with retry mechanisms

## Error Handling

### Graceful Degradation
- Continues processing when some repositories are inaccessible
- Provides detailed error reporting for failed repositories
- Includes partial results in final milestone

### Common Error Scenarios

1. **Repository Not Found**: Marked as inaccessible, continues with others
2. **Permission Denied**: Reported in milestone, analysis continues
3. **Rate Limit Exceeded**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff
4. **Timeout**: Individual repository timeout protection
5. **Network Issues**: Retry mechanisms with progressive delays

## Output Format

### Multi-Repository Milestone

The generated milestone includes:

```markdown
# üåê Multi-Repository Development Plan

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No repositories were accessible for analysis"**
- Verify repository names and owners are correct
- Check GitHub access permissions for all repositories
- Ensure repositories exist and are not private/restricted

**"Rate limit exceeded for multi-plan creation"**
- Wait 1 minute between multi-repository plan requests
- Consider breaking large repository sets into smaller groups

**"Repository analysis timed out"**
- Large repositories may exceed individual timeout limits
- Consider analyzing smaller subsets of repositories
- Check repository size and complexity

**"Invalid repository name"**
- Ensure repository names follow GitHub naming conventions
- Remove invalid characters or excessively long names
- Verify repository exists and is spelled correctly
